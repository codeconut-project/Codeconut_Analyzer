Coveron Analyzer is the post procsessing tool for the Coveron Instrumenter.
The provided metrics adhere to the standards and requirements of the
automotive and aviation industry (i.e. ISO 26262).

The goal is to create a free to use code coverage tool that supports
metrics which are more helpful and easier to understand than the ones
from existing tools (i.e. gcov). Coveron is a
invasive code coverage tool that instruments your source code prior to
the compilation process. Using this method, Coveron is able to
generate the execution tables necessary for MC/DC coverage analysis.

Coveron is the project of Glenn Töws' bachelor thesis for his degree
in electrical engineering and currently is in it's planning phase.
